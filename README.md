# BetterPikes
Take note that this mod requires Realistic Battle Mod's Combat and AI modules. I will not make a non-RBM version.

Currently, the pikes in RBM have a weapon length of less than 400 (4 meters) because the angle of the pike in the vanilla pike bracing animation is too high to hit enemy cavalry.

This mod increases the weapon length of the pikes to more than 400 and lowers the angle of the pike in the pike bracing animation in order to hit enemy cavalry. A melee weapon is considered a pike if its weapon length is at least 400.

It also increases the damage of the pikes so that pikemen are devastating from the front, and edits menavliatons and elite menavliatons to use pikes.

Finally, it makes pikemen use deep shield wall formations that resemble pike formations. These formations are tightly spaced and slow-moving.

Pikemen will drop their pike if they are hit by a melee weapon and their HP is below a certain limit. This is so that they can fight enemies who are hitting them with shorter melee weapons.

This mod is still a work-in-progress. The next thing to do is to edit the idle, walk and run animations while holding a pike so that the pikes are held upright instead of sideways, as is the case with the vanilla animations.

It is safe to install and uninstall on an existing save.
